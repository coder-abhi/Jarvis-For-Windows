Tis some visitor  I muttered  tapping at my chamber door Only this and nothing more.? Ah  distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December; And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor. Eagerly I wished the morrow vainly I had sought to borrow From my books surcease of sorrow sorrow for the lost Lenore For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name LenoreNameless here for evermore. And the silken  sad  uncertain rustling of each purple curtain Thrilled me filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before So that now  to still the beating of my heart  I stood repeating Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber doorThis it is and nothing more.Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer  Sir  said I  ?or Madam  truly your forgiveness I implore; But the fact is I was napping  and so gently you came rapping  And so faintly you came tapping  tapping at my chamber door  That I scarce was sure I heard you here I opened wide the doorDarkness there and nothing more. Deep into that darkness peering  long I stood there wondering  fearing  Doubting  dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before But the silence was unbroken  and the stillness gave no token  And the only word there spoken was the whispered word  Lenore? This I whispered  and an echo murmured back the word  Lenore! Merely this and nothing more. Back into the chamber turning  all my soul within me burning  Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before. Surely  said I surely that is something at my window latticeLet me see  then  what thereat is  and this mystery exploreLet my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore Tis the wind and nothing more! Open here I flung the shutter  when  with many a flirt and flutter  In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore; Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he But  with mien of lord or lady  perched above my chamber door Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door Perched  and sat  and nothing more. Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling  By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore  Though thy crest be shorn and shaven  thou I said  ?art sure no craven  Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night Plutonian shore! Quoth the Raven Nevermore.Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly  Though its answer little meaning little relevancy bore For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door  With such name as ?Nevermore. But the Raven  sitting lonely on the placid bust  spoke only That one word  as if his soul in that one word he did outpour. Nothing farther then he uttered-not a feather then he flutteredTill I scarcely more than muttered Other friends have flown before On the morrow he will leave me  as my Hopes have flown before.Then the bird said Nevermore.Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken  Doubtless ? said I what it utters is its only stock and store Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore Of Never nevermoreBut the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling  Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird  and bust and doorThen  upon the velvet sinking  I betook myself to linking Fancy unto fancy  thinking what this ominous bird of yore  What this grim  ungainly  ghastly  gaunt  and ominous bird of yore Meant in croaking Nevermore.This I sat engaged in guessing  but no syllable expressing To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosoms core; This and more I sat divining  with my head at ease reclining On the cushions velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated oer  But whose velvet-violet lining with the lamp-light gloating oer  She shall press  ah  nevermore! Then  methought  the air grew denser  perfumed from an unseen censer Swung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor. Wretch I cried thy God hath lent thee by these angels he hath sent thee Respite respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore Quaff  oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore! Quoth the Raven ?Nevermore.Prophet! said I  thing of evil! prophet still  if bird or devil! Whether Tempter sent  or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore  Desolate yet all undaunted  on this desert land enchanted On this home by Horror haunted tell me truly  I implore Is there is there balm in Gilead tell me tell me  I implore! Quoth the Raven Nevermore.Prophet! said I thing of evil prophet still  if bird or devil! By that Heaven that bends above us by that God we both adore Tell this soul with sorrow laden if  within the distant Aidenn It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore. Quoth the Raven Nevermore. Be that word our sign of parting  bird or fiend!? I shrieked  upstarting Get thee back into the tempest and the Nights Plutonian shore! Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken! Leave my loneliness unbroken! quit the bust above my door! Take thy beak from out my heart  and take thy form from off my door! Quoth the Raven Nevermore. And the Raven  never flitting  still is sitting  still is sitting On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon that is dreaming  And the lamp-light oer him streaming throws his shadow on the floor And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor Shall be lifted nevermore!

what is the turning test?	Alan Turing's 1950 article Computing Machinery and Intelligence discussed conditions for considering a machine to be intelligent. He argued that if the machine could successfully pretend to be human to a knowledgeable observer then you certainly should consider it intelligent. This test would satisfy most people but not all philosophers. The observer could interact with the machine and a human by teletype (to avoid requiring that the machine imitate the appearance or voice of the person)  and the human would try to persuade the observer that it was human and the machine would try to fool the observer. 	
When did AI research start?	After world war 2  a number of people independently started to work on intelligent machines. The English mathematician Alan Turing may have been the first. He gave a lecture on it in 1947. He also may have been the first to decide that A I was best researched by programming computers rather than by building machines. By the late 1950s  there were many researchers on A I  and most of them were basing their work on programming computers.

What is the Solar System	"The Solar System formed 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a giant molecular cloud. The vast majority of the system's mass is in the Sun with most of the remaining mass contained in Jupiter. The four smaller inner planets Mercury Venus Earth and Mars also called the terrestrial planets are primarily composed of rock and metal. The four outer planets called the gas giants are substantially more massive than the terrestrials. The two largest Jupiter and Saturn are composed mainly of hydrogen and helium; the two outermost planets Uranus and Neptune are composed largely of substances with relatively high melting points (compared with hydrogen and helium) called ices such as water ammonia and methane and are often referred to separately as ""ice giants"". All planets have almost circular orbits that lie within a nearly flat disc called the ecliptic plane."	
Tell me about our Solar system	"The Solar System also contains regions populated by smaller objects. The asteroid belt which lies between Mars and Jupiter mostly contains objects composed like the terrestrial planets of rock and metal. Beyond Neptune's orbit lie the Kuiper belt and scattered disc linked populations of trans-Neptunian objects composed mostly of ices. Within these populations are several dozen to more than ten thousand objects that may be large enough to have been rounded by their own gravity. Such objects are referred to as dwarf planets. Identified dwarf planets include the asteroid Ceres and the trans-Neptunian objects Pluto and Eris. In addition to these two regions various other small-body populations including comets centaurs and interplanetary dust freely travel between regions. Six of the planets at least three of the dwarf planets and many of the smaller bodies are orbited by natural satellites[e] usually termed ""moons"" after Earth's Moon. Each of the outer planets is encircled by planetary rings of dust and other small objects."	
What are the outer planets	Well there is the Sun Mercury Venus Earth Mars Jupiter Saturn Uranus and Neptune until some somebody changes there mind on what a planet is. Also there are numerous moons and astroids in our Solar System. It is situated on the outskirts of one of the arms of the Milky Way Galaxie

I's	It is not my aim to surprise or shock you?but the simplest way I can summarize is to say that there are now in the world machines that can think  that can learn and that can create.

The struggles within yourself?the invisible battles inside all of us?that?s where it?s at. ?Jesse Owens|What?s money? A man is a success if he gets up in the morning and goes to bed at night and in between does what he wants to do. ?Bob Dylan|If you want your children to turn out well, spend twice as much time with them, and half as much money. ?Abigail Van Buren|It is not what you do for your children, but what you have taught them to do for themselves, that will make them successful human beings. ?Ann Landers|First, have a definite, clear practical ideal; a goal, an objective. Second, have the necessary means to achieve your ends; wisdom, money, materials, and methods. Third, adjust all your means to that end. ?Aristotle|I have been impressed with the urgency of doing.

When I went to school, they asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up. I wrote down ?happy?. They told me I didn?t understand the assignment, and I told them they didn?t understand life. ?John Lennon|Certain things catch your eye, but pursue only those that capture the heart. ? Ancient Indian Proverb|Few things can help an individual more than to place responsibility on him, and to let him know that you trust him. Booker T. Washington|When I stand before God at the end of my life, I would hope that I would not have a single bit of talent left and could say, I used everything you gave me. ?Erma Bombeck|People often say that motivation doesn?t last.
